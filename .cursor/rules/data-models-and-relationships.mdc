## Core Domain Models

### Laboratory Submission Model (Importance: 95)
Core model representing a laboratory sample submission with comprehensive metadata:

- **AdministrativeInfo**:
  - Submitter details (name, email, department)
  - Project information and priority level
  - Submission timestamps and status

- **SourceMaterial**: 
  - Sample origin and type
  - Collection date and conditions
  - Material properties (concentration, volume)

- **PoolingInfo**:
  - Multiplexing strategy
  - Sample combinations
  - Pooling ratios and conditions

- **SequenceGeneration**:
  - Platform configuration
  - Chemistry version
  - Run parameters
  - Quality thresholds

- **ContainerInfo**:
  - Storage requirements
  - Container type and dimensions
  - Temperature conditions
  - Location tracking

- **InformaticsInfo**:
  - Analysis requirements
  - Data delivery format
  - Custom pipeline parameters

- **SampleDetails**:
  - Sample identifiers and metadata
  - Quality scores
  - Processing history
  - Current status

    LabSubmission --> ContainerInfo
    LabSubmission --> InformaticsInfo

```

### Validation Rules (Importance: 85)
- Administrative data requires submitter contact information
- Source material must specify type and collection details
- Container information must include storage requirements
- Sample details require unique identifiers
- Sequencing data requires platform specification
