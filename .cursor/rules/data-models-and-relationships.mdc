# Data Models and Relationships

## Core Domain Models

### AdministrativeInfo
Captures submitter and project information:
- Submitter name, email, department, role
- Project identifiers and approvals
- Administrative metadata with audit trail

### SourceMaterial
Defines biological sample properties:
- Material type (DNA, RNA, cells, tissue)
- Origin and collection details  
- Storage requirements and conditions
- Sample quality metrics

### PoolingInfo
Manages sample pooling configurations:
- Pool composition and ratios
- Barcode/index assignments
- QC requirements per pool
- Cross-contamination controls

### SequenceGeneration  
Controls sequencing parameters:
- Platform-specific configurations
- Read length and coverage targets
- Chemistry version and requirements
- Run QC thresholds

### ContainerInfo
Tracks physical sample containers:
- Container type and specifications
- Volume and concentration data
- Temperature requirements
- Position tracking in storage

### InformaticsInfo
Defines analysis requirements:
- Reference genome versions
- Analysis pipeline parameters
- Output format specifications
- Computational requirements

### SampleDetails
Comprehensive sample tracking:
- Unique identifiers and barcodes
- Processing status and history
- Quality control metrics
- Chain of custody
