## Core Data Models

### Laboratory Submission Models
- **AdministrativeInfo**: Captures submitter details, project codes, and institutional affiliations
- **SourceMaterial**: Defines sample material types, collection parameters, storage requirements
- **PoolingInfo**: Manages sample pooling strategies and multiplexing configurations  
- **SequenceGeneration**: Contains sequencing parameters, platform requirements, coverage targets
- **ContainerInfo**: Tracks container specifications, volumes, concentrations
- **InformaticsInfo**: Stores analysis pipeline requirements and parameters
- **SampleDetails**: Maintains sample metadata, quality metrics, tracking IDs

### Storage Management Models
- **StorageLocation**: Manages temperature zones (-80째C, -20째C, 4째C, RT, 37째C), capacity tracking
- **Sample**: Tracks sample movements, storage conditions, chain of custody
- **IoTSensor**: Monitors environmental conditions with threshold alerts
- **AutomationTask**: Orchestrates robotic sample handling operations

### Laboratory Workflow Models
- **LabSubmission**: Parent record for complete submission workflow
- **ExtractionResult**: Captures document extraction confidence and metadata
- **QueryResult**: Stores natural language query responses with relevance scores
- **DocumentChunk**: Manages segmented laboratory documents with vector embeddings

### Quality Control Models
- **ComplianceEvent**: Records regulatory compliance checks
- **QualityMetric**: Tracks sample and process quality scores
- **MaintenanceRecord**: Documents equipment calibration and service

### Domain-Specific Validation Rules
- Sample type compatibility with storage conditions
- Temperature zone requirements validation
- Material concentration and volume constraints
- Pooling strategy validation for sequencing
- Container capacity and compatibility checks

### Relationship Constraints
- Samples must have valid storage locations
- Submissions require administrative and sample details
- Quality metrics tied to samples and equipment
- IoT sensors mapped to storage locations
