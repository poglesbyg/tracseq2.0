## Core Domain Models

### Sample Submission Models
- `AdministrativeInfo`: Captures administrative metadata including submitter info, project details, contact info
- `SourceMaterial`: Records material properties like type, collection info, storage conditions
- `PoolingInfo`: Handles multiplexing configuration including barcodes, pooling ratios
- `SequenceGeneration`: Stores sequencing parameters, platform details, read requirements
- `ContainerInfo`: Defines container specs, volumes, concentrations
- `InformaticsInfo`: Manages analysis requirements, reference genomes, pipeline configs
- `SampleDetails`: Contains core sample data including IDs, quality metrics, priority levels

### Business Logic in Model Relationships

- **Administrative Linkage**
```
AdministrativeInfo 1:1 LabSubmission
SampleDetails N:1 LabSubmission 
```

- **Material Flow**
```
SourceMaterial 1:N PoolingInfo
PoolingInfo 1:1 SequenceGeneration
```

- **Container Management** 
```
ContainerInfo 1:1 SampleDetails
ContainerInfo 1:N StorageLocation
```

### Model Validation Rules

- `SampleValidator`: Enforces domain rules for sample data validation:
  - Empty names not allowed
  - Barcode length requirements
  - Valid storage conditions
  - Required metadata fields

- `SubmissionPolicies`: Defines business policies for submissions:
  - Required metadata per submission type
  - Storage condition requirements
  - Sequencing job creation rules

### Export Transformations

- Document to Sample Data conversion rules
- Template to Sample record mapping
- Structured formats (JSON, CSV) for interoperability
- Maintains relationships during export

### Notable Relationships

- Container tracking via barcode references
- Sample to storage location mapping
- Project to submission linkage
- Sequential workflow state transitions
