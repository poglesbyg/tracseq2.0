# rag-algorithms

The RAG system implements specialized algorithms for processing laboratory documents and extracting structured information through several key components:

### Document Processing Pipeline
- Extracts text from PDF, DOCX, and TXT files using format-specific extractors
- Chunks documents based on laboratory domain knowledge using a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
- Maintains document metadata including file path, page numbers, and chunk indices
- Assigns unique identifiers based on file stem, page number, and chunk position

### Information Extraction
- Uses LLM prompting to extract structured data from documents, focusing on laboratory-specific fields:
  - Administrative information (submitter details, project info)
  - Sample information (type, quantity, conditions)
  - Sequencing requirements (platform, read length)
  - Storage specifications (temperature, container type)
- Assigns confidence scores to extracted information
- Falls back to template-based extraction for standard forms

### Vector Store Implementation
- Uses ChromaDB for storing document embeddings
- Generates embeddings using SentenceTransformer with 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model
- Implements similarity search with configurable thresholds
- Maintains metadata about embeddings including model version and timestamp

### Query Processing
- Processes natural language queries about laboratory submissions
- Uses vector similarity to retrieve relevant context chunks
- Enhances responses with structured data from database
- Provides confidence scores for responses

### MLOps Pipeline Integration
- Tracks RAG model performance metrics
- Implements A/B testing for extraction algorithms
- Supports continuous learning from user feedback
- Monitors extraction quality and confidence trends

### Resilience Mechanisms
- Implements retry logic for LLM calls
- Provides fallback mechanisms between local and cloud LLMs
- Caches extraction results to improve performance
- Handles partial extraction results gracefully
