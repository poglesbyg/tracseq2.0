Core RAG Algorithm Components:

1. Laboratory Document Processing
- Domain-specific chunking for laboratory submissions
- Laboratory-specific relevance scoring based on:
  * Sample information density 
  * Quality control metrics
  * Chain of custody requirements
  * Storage specifications
  * Protocol adherence

2. Information Extraction Pipelines
- Field extraction using LLM templates specialized for:
  * Administrative metadata
  * Sample specifications 
  * Storage requirements
  * Quality control parameters
  * Chain of custody tracking
- Confidence scoring based on field completeness and validation

3. Laboratory-Specific Query Processing
- Context enrichment with:
  * Active sample information
  * Storage conditions
  * Processing workflows
  * Quality metrics
- Response generation incorporating:
  * Laboratory best practices
  * Safety guidelines
  * Compliance requirements
  * Protocol recommendations

4. Multi-Agent Coordination
- Specialized agents for:
  * Document processing
  * Quality control
  * Storage allocation
  * Notification handling
- Agent orchestration based on:
  * Sample priority
  * Quality scores
  * Resource availability
  * Processing requirements

5. Confidence Scoring System
- Multi-factor scoring incorporating:
  * Field extraction completeness
  * Data validation results
  * Pattern matching confidence
  * Laboratory requirement compliance
  * Cross-reference validation
