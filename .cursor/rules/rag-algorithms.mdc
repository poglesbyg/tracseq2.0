# rag-algorithms

The system implements specialized RAG algorithms for laboratory document processing:

1. Laboratory Document Processing Pipeline:
- Parses laboratory submissions and metadata using specialized extractors:
  * Administrative data (submitter details, project info)
  * Sample information (type, concentration, volume)
  * Sequencing specifications (platform, parameters)
  * Storage conditions (temperature, container)
- Implements confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) for extracted information
- Path: `lab_submission_rag/lab_workflows/document_processing.py`

2. Quality Control Workflow:
- Multi-stage extraction pipeline with self-correction:
  * Initial extraction with base confidence threshold (0.85)
  * Automated retry with improved prompts if confidence < threshold
  * Maximum 3 retry attempts before human review
  * Confidence recalculation after each retry
- Path: `lab_submission_rag/lab_workflows/quality_control.py`

3. Laboratory Query System:
- Context-aware query processing:
  * Maintains conversation history
  * Tracks sample and project references
  * Incorporates laboratory domain knowledge
- Specialized prompt enhancement for laboratory terminology
- Path: `lab_submission_rag/rag/enhanced_llm_interface.py`

4. Vector Storage Management:
- Custom chunking optimized for laboratory documents
- Metadata tracking for sample submissions
- Source document relationship preservation
- Path: `lab_submission_rag/rag/vector_store.py`

5. MLOps Integration:
- A/B testing for extraction models
- Continuous learning from validation feedback
- Automated model retraining based on performance metrics
- Path: `lab_submission_rag/mlops/continuous_learning.py`

Core algorithms prioritize:
- Laboratory data extraction accuracy
- Sample tracking integrity 
- Chain of custody maintenance
- Regulatory compliance validation
- Document relationship preservation
