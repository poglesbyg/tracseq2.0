## Document Processing Pipeline

The RAG system implements specialized processing for laboratory documents:

- Category-based information extraction targeting:
  - Administrative data
  - Sample details 
  - Sequencing requirements
  - Storage conditions
  - Equipment parameters

- Confidence scoring based on:
  - Extraction completeness (0-100%)
  - Data validation status
  - Cross-reference verification
  - Document quality metrics

- Custom chunking strategy:
  - Section-aware splits
  - Metadata preservation
  - Reference tracking
  - Context windows

## Vector Indexing and Search

- Laboratory-optimized vector store:
  - Cosine similarity threshold: 0.7
  - Re-ranking based on:
    - Document recency
    - Confidence scores  
    - Metadata relevance

- Query enhancement:
  - Laboratory term expansion
  - Protocol-aware filtering
  - Equipment parameter matching
  - Sample type correlation

## Integration Points

- Lab Manager synchronization:
  - Submission tracking
  - Sample record creation
  - Workflow initiation
  - Status updates

- Document Processing:
  - PDF/DOCX/TXT support
  - OCR optimization
  - Table extraction
  - Form recognition
