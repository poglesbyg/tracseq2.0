## Core RAG Pipeline Components

### Document Processing Engine
- Specialized chunking strategy for laboratory documents optimized for:
  - Sample information sections
  - Protocol details 
  - Analysis requirements
  - Technical specifications
- Custom validation rules for laboratory document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Metadata extraction focused on laboratory-relevant fields

### Information Extraction System
- Domain-specific prompt engineering for laboratory data extraction:
  - Administrative details (submitter, department, PI)
  - Sample characteristics (type, volume, concentration)
  - Storage requirements (temperature, container type)
  - Processing protocols
  - Analysis specifications
- Confidence scoring mechanism for extracted information

### Vector Store Integration
- Laboratory document embedding strategy:
  - Document-chunk relationship preservation
  - Metadata-aware similarity search
  - Laboratory context retention
- Specialized retrieval mechanism with:
  - Category-based filtering
  - Confidence thresholding
  - Context aggregation for laboratory specifics

### Query Processing Engine 
- Laboratory-specific query understanding:
  - Sample lookup patterns
  - Protocol matching
  - Requirements validation
  - Storage condition verification
- Enhanced context building with:
  - Metadata enrichment
  - Laboratory terminology expansion
  - Domain-specific relevance scoring

```

Key Business Rules:
1. Document validation must ensure laboratory safety and compliance requirements
2. Extraction confidence below 0.85 requires manual verification
3. Vector similarity must account for laboratory protocol compatibility
4. Query results must maintain sample chain of custody
