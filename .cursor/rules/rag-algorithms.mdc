### Core RAG Components

1. Document Processing (Importance: 95)
- Specialized chunking algorithm for laboratory documents that preserves metadata structure
- Seven-category extraction framework: Administrative, Source Material, Pooling, Sequence Generation, Container, Informatics, Sample Details
- Context-aware document segmentation based on laboratory document formats
- File: `lab_submission_rag/rag/document_processor.py`

2. Vector Store Management (Importance: 90) 
- ChromaDB implementation with laboratory-specific metadata filtering
- Dynamic embedding generation optimized for scientific content
- Storage size monitoring and management
- File: `lab_submission_rag/rag/vector_store.py`

3. LLM Interface (Importance: 85)
- Multi-provider support (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic) with failover
- Domain-specific prompt engineering for laboratory data extraction
- Confidence scoring for extracted information
- Mock response generation for testing
- File: `lab_submission_rag/rag/llm_interface.py`

4. RAG Orchestration (Importance: 95)
- End-to-end pipeline coordination for document processing
- Query-based information retrieval with laboratory context
- Batch processing workflow for multiple documents
- Export functionality for extracted data
- File: `lab_submission_rag/rag_orchestrator.py`

### Laboratory-Specific Features

1. Information Extraction Categories (Importance: 90)
