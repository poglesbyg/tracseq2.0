Core RAG Algorithm Components:

1. Laboratory Document Processing Pipeline
- Custom document chunking optimized for laboratory submissions:
  * Administrative sections (submitter, project details)
  * Sample specifications (type, concentration, storage)
  * Sequencing requirements (platform, coverage, read length)
- Context-aware text segmentation preserving laboratory metadata
- Temperature and measurement unit standardization (-80°C, μg/μL)

2. Information Extraction Rules
- Multi-stage extraction process:
  * Basic field parsing with confidence scoring
  * Domain validation against laboratory standards
  * Quality control with threshold validation (0.7 minimum)
  * Cross-reference validation for sample IDs
- Laboratory-specific entity recognition for:
  * Sample barcodes
  * Equipment IDs
  * Storage locations
  * Protocol references

3. RAG Query Processing
- Specialized prompt engineering for laboratory context
- Response generation incorporating:
  * Storage condition requirements
  * Sample handling protocols
  * Equipment compatibility rules
  * Safety guidelines
- Knowledge base integration with laboratory standards

4. Quality Control System
- Automated validation of extracted information:
  * Required field completeness
  * Unit compatibility
  * Value range verification
  * Cross-reference integrity
- Self-correction mechanisms with domain expertise

5. Laboratory MLOps Integration
- Model performance tracking with domain metrics
- A/B testing for extraction accuracy
- Continuous learning from laboratory feedback
- Version control for model improvements
