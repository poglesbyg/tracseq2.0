## Core Data Flow Components

1. **Document Ingestion Pipeline**
- Documents enter through multiple channels:
  - Web UI upload portal
  - Automated folder monitoring 
  - API submissions
  - Email attachments
- Files are validated and queued for processing based on priority levels
- Raw documents stored in staging with generated IDs
- Document metadata extraction starts parallel to storage

2. **RAG Processing Pipeline**
- Document chunking optimized for laboratory content
- Vector embeddings generated using biomedical model
- Chunks stored in ChromaDB with metadata linking
- LLM extraction of structured laboratory data:
  - Administrative information
  - Sample details
  - Sequencing requirements
  - Storage conditions

3. **Laboratory Database Integration**
- Extracted data validated against lab schemas
- Sample records created in lab_manager database
- Storage assignments generated based on requirements
- Notification events triggered for new submissions

4. **Query Processing Flow**
- Natural language queries parsed for intent
- Relevant chunks retrieved from vector store
- Context assembled from multiple sources:
  - Retrieved document chunks
  - Database records
  - Template definitions
- Responses generated with citations

5. **Event Propagation**
- Document status changes trigger notifications
- Sample creation events flow to storage service
- Template updates propagate to document processors
- System alerts route through notification service

Key File Paths:
```
lab_submission_rag/core/document_processor.py
lab_submission_rag/rag/vector_store.py 
lab_submission_rag/services/notification.py
lab_manager/src/data/sample_processor.rs
notification_service/src/handlers/events.rs
```

The data flow patterns emphasize reliable document processing, structured data extraction, and event-driven integration between laboratory services.
