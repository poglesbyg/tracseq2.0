## Document Processing Pipeline

### Sample Submission Flow
- Document uploaded through web interface
- Text extracted and chunked by DocumentProcessor
- Chunks vectorized and stored in ChromaDB
- LLM extracts structured information using category-specific prompts
- Results validated against confidence thresholds
- Submission created in database if extraction succeeds

### RAG Query Processing
- Natural language query received from frontend
- Similar document chunks retrieved from vector store
- Context assembled from relevant chunks
- LLM generates response using context
- Response returned with confidence score and sources

### Information Extraction Workflow
- Seven categories of lab information extracted:
  - Administrative details
  - Sample information
  - Storage requirements
  - Sequencing specifications
  - Pooling data
  - Quality control
  - Analysis requirements
- Each category has custom validation rules
- Confidence scoring per category

### Batch Processing Pattern
- Multiple documents processed concurrently
- Progress tracked per document
- Aggregate metrics calculated:
  - Success rate
  - Average confidence
  - Processing time
- Failed documents flagged for review

### Chain of Custody Flow
- Sample movements tracked through storage system
- Temperature zone transitions logged
- Location history maintained
- Handling events recorded with timestamps

### Quality Control Pipeline
- Sample quality metrics extracted
- QC thresholds validated
- Results logged with confidence scores
- Failed QC triggers notifications
