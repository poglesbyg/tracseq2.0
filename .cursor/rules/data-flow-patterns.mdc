### Primary Data Flow Pipelines

1. Document Processing Pipeline (Score: 95)
- Document ingestion → Chunking → Vector embedding → Storage in ChromaDB
- Specialized extraction patterns for laboratory submission documents
- Information categorized into 7 domain categories (Administrative, Source Material, etc.)
File: `lab_submission_rag/rag/document_processor.py`

2. RAG Orchestration Flow (Score: 90) 
- Document chunks → Relevance search → LLM context assembly → Information extraction
- Maintains conversation context for follow-up queries
- Handles batch processing of multiple documents
File: `lab_submission_rag/rag/rag_orchestrator.py`

3. Sample Processing Pipeline (Score: 85)
- Sample submission → Metadata validation → Barcode generation → Storage assignment
- Template-based batch uploads with data mapping
- Automated sample sheet creation for sequencing jobs
File: `lab_manager/examples/modular_usage.rs`

### Information Extraction Workflows

1. Laboratory Document Analysis (Score: 88)
- Multi-stage extraction process targeting specific document sections
- Confidence scoring system for extracted information
- Fallback mechanisms for unclear or missing information
File: `lab_submission_rag/rag/llm_interface.py`

2. Data Transformation Chain (Score: 82)
- Document → Structured data → Sample records → Storage records
- Template mapping for standardized submissions
- Validation at each transformation stage
File: `lab_manager/src/sample_submission/document_conversion.rs`

### Query Processing Patterns

1. Natural Language Query Flow (Score: 85)
- Query → Vector search → Context assembly → Enhanced response generation
- Domain-specific knowledge integration
- Conversation history management
File: `lab_submission_rag/rag/enhanced_llm_interface.py`

2. Sample Information Retrieval (Score: 80)
- Barcode-based lookups
- Storage location tracking
- Status monitoring across processing stages
File: `lab_manager/src/storage/barcode_tracking.rs`

### Data Models Flow

1. Submission Information Model (Score: 92)
- Comprehensive data structure covering all laboratory submission aspects
- Validation rules for each information category
- Transformation logic for different output formats
File: `lab_submission_rag/models/submission.py`

2. Storage and Tracking Model (Score: 85)
- Location tracking with state transitions
- Storage condition validation
- Sample relationship mapping
File: `lab_manager/src/storage/storage_validation.rs`
