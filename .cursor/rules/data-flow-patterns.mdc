# data-flow-patterns

The data flow patterns in this laboratory information system focus on two main paths: document processing and sample management.

## Document Processing Pipeline
Importance Score: 95

The RAG system implements a multi-stage document processing pipeline:

1. Initial Document Ingestion
- Documents uploaded through web interface or file system monitoring
- Automatic file type detection and validation
- Assignment to processing queue with priority levels

2. Document Chunking and Processing 
- Text extraction based on document type
- Recursive chunking with configurable overlap
- Chunk enrichment with metadata
- Vector embedding generation

3. Information Extraction
- RAG-based extraction using prompt templates
- Structured data mapping to laboratory schema
- Confidence scoring and validation
- Failed extraction retry with different models

## Sample Management Flow 
Importance Score: 90

The sample workflow orchestrates:

1. Sample Creation
- From processed documents or manual entry
- Automated barcode generation
- Multi-level validation
- Storage location assignment

2. Sample State Transitions
```
Pending -> Validated -> InStorage -> InSequencing -> Completed
```

3. Storage Management
- Real-time capacity tracking
- Temperature zone control (-80°C to 37°C)
- Chain of custody logging
- Container organization hierarchy

## Integration Points
Importance Score: 85

Key data flow integration points:

1. Database Integration
- Submission storage with RAG system tables
- Sample tracking tables
- Storage management tables
- Audit logging tables

2. External Systems
- Sequencing equipment integration
- Storage system monitoring
- Laboratory information system (LIMS) sync
- Authentication system integration
