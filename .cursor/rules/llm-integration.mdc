# llm-integration

## RAG System Architecture

### Laboratory Document Processing
- **Custom Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for extracting laboratory metadata, sample information, and sequencing requirements from scientific documents
- **Context Management**: Laboratory-aware context building using domain-specific chunking and relevance scoring
- **Query Processing**: Natural language query handling tailored for laboratory operations and sample management workflows

### Multi-Model Integration
- **Model Selection Logic**: Intelligent routing between local Ollama models and cloud APIs based on task complexity and confidence requirements
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation with simulated responses when LLM services are unavailable
- **Confidence Scoring**: Domain-specific scoring system for extraction quality and response reliability

### Laboratory Information Extraction
- **Field Validation**: Laboratory-specific validation rules for extracted metadata fields
- **Data Transformation**: Custom mapping of extracted information to laboratory management schema
- **Quality Assessment**: Multi-factor quality scoring incorporating domain knowledge and data completeness

### Enhanced Response Generation
- **Laboratory Knowledge Base**: Integration of domain-specific knowledge for enhancing responses
- **Workflow Awareness**: Response generation incorporating laboratory protocols and procedures
- **Quality Control**: Domain-specific validation of generated responses against laboratory standards

### Vector Store Management
- **Laboratory Document Indexing**: Specialized indexing strategies for scientific documents
- **Semantic Search**: Domain-aware similarity search incorporating laboratory terminology
- **Version Control**: Document versioning system aligned with laboratory requirements
