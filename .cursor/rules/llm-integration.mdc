# LLM Integration

## LLM Interface Components

### Document Processing Engine
Specialized tokenization and chunking for laboratory documents with domain-specific knowledge preservation. Processes PDFs, DOCX files and spreadsheets containing laboratory submission data.

### Information Extraction Pipeline 
Multi-stage pipeline extracts key laboratory metadata:
- Administrative info (submitter details, project info)
- Sample details (type, concentration, volume)
- Sequencing requirements (platform, read length)
- Storage conditions (temperature, container type)

Implements confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) for extracted fields.

### Laboratory-Specific Prompt Engineering
Custom prompts enriched with:
- Laboratory terminology
- Sample naming conventions  
- Equipment specifications
- Protocol structures
- Quality requirements

### RAG System Integration
Vector store maintains laboratory document embeddings for:
- Natural language querying of submissions
- Sample detail lookups
- Protocol searching
- Equipment specifications

### Critical Components

**Enhanced LLM Interface**
- Multi-model support (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Fallback mechanisms for model availability
- Laboratory domain prompting system
- Confidence scoring for extractions

**Document Pre/Post Processing**
- Laboratory form recognition
- Table extraction for sample sheets  
- Quality scoring for document clarity
- Validation against templates

Score: 95 - Core business logic for laboratory document processing
