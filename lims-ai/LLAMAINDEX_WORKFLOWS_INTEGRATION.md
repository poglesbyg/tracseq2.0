# LlamaIndex Workflows 1.0 Integration Guide for TracSeq 2.0

## Executive Summary

LlamaIndex Workflows 1.0 provides a powerful event-driven framework that can significantly enhance the TracSeq 2.0 laboratory management system. This integration brings:

- **Event-driven orchestration** for complex multi-step processes
- **Self-correcting loops** for quality control and validation
- **Parallel processing** capabilities for improved performance
- **Built-in observability** for debugging and monitoring
- **Gradual migration path** from existing RAG orchestrator

## Integration Overview

### What We've Implemented

1. **Document Processing Workflow** (`document_processing.py`)
   - Replaces monolithic RAG orchestrator with event-driven steps
   - Improves error handling and retry logic
   - Enables parallel chunk processing

2. **Quality Control Workflow** (`quality_control.py`)
   - Implements confidence-based validation
   - Self-correcting extraction with retry logic
   - Optional human-in-the-loop approval

3. **MLOps Experiment Tracking** (`experiment_tracking.py`)
   - A/B testing for model comparison
   - Automated deployment decisions
   - Performance tracking and monitoring

4. **Multi-Agent Coordination** (`multi_agent.py`)
   - Orchestrates specialized agents for different tasks
   - Event-based communication between agents
   - Comprehensive activity logging

5. **Integration Adapter** (`workflow_integration.py`)
   - Compatibility layer with existing system
   - Gradual migration support
   - FastAPI endpoint integration

## Key Benefits for TracSeq 2.0

### 1. Improved Document Processing
```python
# Before: Sequential processing
result = await rag_orchestrator.process_document(file_path)

# After: Event-driven with better control
workflow = DocumentProcessingWorkflow()
result = await workflow.run(file_path=file_path)
```

### 2. Self-Correcting Quality Control
The quality control workflow automatically retries extraction with feedback:
- Detects validation errors
- Provides feedback to LLM for correction
- Retries up to configurable maximum attempts
- Falls back to human review if needed

### 3. Enhanced MLOps Capabilities
- Run experiments comparing different models
- Automatic deployment of best-performing models
- Comprehensive performance tracking
- Integration with existing MLOps infrastructure

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration
Coordinate specialized agents through events:
- Document Processor → Quality Controller → Storage Allocator → Notifier
- Each agent operates independently
- Event-driven handoffs ensure proper sequencing
- Complete audit trail of agent activities

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Testing (Weeks 1-2)
```python
# Run both systems in parallel
traditional_result = await rag_system.process_document(doc)
workflow_result = await workflow_adapter.process_document(doc)

# Compare results and confidence scores
```

### Phase 2: Selective Adoption (Weeks 3-4)
```python
# Use workflows for specific document types
if doc_type in ['.pdf', '.docx']:
    return await workflow_adapter.process_document(doc)
else:
    return await traditional_adapter.process_document(doc)
```

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Weeks 5-6)
- Replace all RAG orchestrator calls with workflow adapter
- Update API endpoints to use workflow routes
- Migrate background jobs to workflow-based processing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Dependencies
Add to `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
dependencies = [
    # ... existing dependencies ...
    "llama-index-workflows>=1.0.0",
    "llama-index-core>=0.10.0",
    "llama-index-instrumentation>=0.1.0",
]
```

### File Structure
```
lab_submission_rag/
├── workflows/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── document_processing.py
│   ├── quality_control.py
│   ├── experiment_tracking.py
│   ├── multi_agent.py
│   ├── workflow_integration.py
│   ├── example_usage.py
│   └── README.md
```

### API Integration
```python
# In your FastAPI app
from lab_submission_rag.workflows.workflow_integration import create_workflow_routes

app.include_router(create_workflow_routes(app))
```

New endpoints:
- `POST /api/v2/workflows/process` - Document processing
- `POST /api/v2/workflows/multi-agent` - Multi-agent processing

## Performance Improvements

### Parallel Processing
The MLOps workflow evaluates multiple models simultaneously:
```python
# Models are evaluated in parallel, not sequentially
evaluation_events = [
    ModelEvaluationEvent(model_id="model1", ...),
    ModelEvaluationEvent(model_id="model2", ...),
]
# Both evaluations run concurrently
```

### Event Streaming
Monitor workflows in real-time:
```python
handler = workflow.run(document_path=doc_path)
async for event in handler.stream_events():
    print(f"Event: {type(event).__name__}")
```

### Resource Efficiency
- Context object maintains state without redundant processing
- Events carry only necessary data between steps
- Async-first design maximizes throughput

## Observability and Debugging

### Workflow Visualization
```python
from llama_index.workflows import draw_all_possible_flows
draw_all_possible_flows(workflow, "workflow_diagram.png")
```

### Step-by-Step Debugging
```python
ctx = Context(workflow)
await workflow.run_step(ctx)  # Execute one step
print(ctx.data)  # Inspect intermediate state
```

### Comprehensive Logging
All workflows include detailed logging:
```python
logger.info(f"Processing document: {file_path}")
logger.info(f"Extraction completed. Confidence: {score:.2f}")
```

## Future Enhancements
