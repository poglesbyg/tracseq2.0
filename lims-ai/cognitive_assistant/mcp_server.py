## Best Practices
1. **Sample Handling**
   - Always use appropriate PPE
   - Minimize freeze-thaw cycles
   - Maintain cold chain during transport

2. **Documentation**
   - Record all deviations immediately
   - Use standardized nomenclature
   - Maintain complete audit trails

3. **Quality Control**
   - Run controls with every batch
   - Validate new methods before use
   - Regular equipment calibration
