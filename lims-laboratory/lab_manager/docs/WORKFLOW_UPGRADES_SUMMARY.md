  with:
    path: |
      ~/.cargo/registry/index/
      ~/.cargo/registry/cache/
      ~/.cargo/git/db/
      target/
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-cargo-${{ matrix.component }}-${{ hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock') }}
```

### Multi-Platform Builds
```yaml
platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
build-args: |
  BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1
```

### Security Configuration
```yaml
[licenses]
allow = ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause", "ISC", "Unlicense"]
deny = ["GPL-2.0", "GPL-3.0", "AGPL-3.0", "LGPL-2.1", "LGPL-3.0"]
copyleft = "deny"
```
