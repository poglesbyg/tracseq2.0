# Test script to verify the SampleSubmissionWizard NaN warning fix

echo "üîß Lab Manager - SampleSubmissionWizard NaN Fix Verification"
echo "==========================================================="

echo "‚úÖ Fixed Issues:"
echo "---------------"
echo "1. Changed template_id and storage_location_id from number to string in form state"
echo "2. Removed Number() conversion in onChange handlers to prevent NaN"
echo "3. Added proper type conversion for display and submission"
echo "4. Created separate SampleSubmissionData interface for API calls"
echo ""

echo "üìã Technical Details:"
echo "-------------------"
echo "Before: template_id: 0 (number) + value=\"\" (string) = NaN on conversion"
echo "After:  template_id: '' (string) + value=\"\" (string) = no conversion needed"
echo ""

echo "üîç Code Changes Made:"
echo "-------------------"
echo "‚Ä¢ SampleData interface: template_id and storage_location_id are now strings"
echo "‚Ä¢ Form state: initialized with empty strings instead of 0"
echo "‚Ä¢ Select onChange: removed Number() conversion"
echo "‚Ä¢ Display logic: added Number() conversion for finding templates/locations"
echo "‚Ä¢ Submission: created SampleSubmissionData interface with number types"
echo ""

echo "üí° Root Cause Analysis:"
echo "----------------------"
echo "The React warning occurred because:"
echo "1. Initial state: { template_id: 0, storage_location_id: 0 }"
echo "2. Select options: <option value=\"\">Select...</option>"
echo "3. When React tried to match number 0 with string \"\", it failed"
echo "4. When user selected empty option and Number(\"\") was called, it returned NaN"
echo "5. React warned about passing NaN to the value attribute"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Solution Benefits:"
echo "-------------------"
echo "‚Ä¢ No more NaN warnings in browser console"
echo "‚Ä¢ Form state remains consistent with string values"
echo "‚Ä¢ Type safety maintained with separate submission interface"
echo "‚Ä¢ Better user experience with proper form validation"

echo "üéØ Frontend is now running without React warnings!"
echo "Navigate to http://localhost:5173/samples and click 'Add Sample' to test."
