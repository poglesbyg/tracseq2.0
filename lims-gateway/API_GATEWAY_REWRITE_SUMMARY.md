# TracSeq API Gateway Rewrite - Complete Summary

## Overview

I have successfully rewritten the TracSeq API Gateway to properly handle communication between the frontend, microservices, and database. The new implementation ensures seamless integration across the entire TracSeq LIMS ecosystem.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Comprehensive Service Mapping**
- **21 microservices configured** with proper container names and ports
- **Frontend API endpoints analyzed** - mapped all expected endpoints from the React frontend
- **Microservice endpoints reviewed** - catalogued all available endpoints across lims-core/, lims-enhanced/, and lims-laboratory/
- **Database connectivity patterns** - unified database connection across all services

### 2. **Frontend Integration**
The gateway now properly routes all frontend API calls:

#### Authentication & User Management
- `/api/auth/*` → Auth Service (tracseq-auth:8080)
- `/api/users/*` → Auth Service (tracseq-auth:8080)

#### Core Laboratory Services
- `/api/samples/*` → Sample Service (tracseq-samples:8081)
- `/api/storage/*` → Enhanced Storage Service (tracseq-storage:8082) 
- `/api/templates/*` → Template Service (tracseq-templates:8083)

#### Laboratory Workflow Services
- `/api/sequencing/*` → Sequencing Service (tracseq-sequencing:8084)
- `/api/qc/*` → QA/QC Service (tracseq-qaqc:8103)
- `/api/library-prep/*` → Library Prep Service (tracseq-library-prep:8102)
- `/api/flow-cells/*` → Flow Cell Service (tracseq-flow-cells:8104)
- `/api/projects/*` → Project Service (tracseq-projects:8101)

#### Enhanced Services
- `/api/notifications/*` → Notification Service (tracseq-notification:8085)
- `/api/events/*` → Event Service (tracseq-events:8087)
- `/api/spreadsheets/*` → Spreadsheet Service (tracseq-spreadsheet:8088)
- `/api/reports/*` → Reports Service (tracseq-reports:8014)
- `/api/dashboard/*` → Dashboard Service (tracseq-dashboard:8015)

#### AI Services
- `/api/rag/*` → RAG Service (tracseq-rag:8000)
- `/api/chat/*` → Chat Service (tracseq-rag:8000)

### 3. **Database Connectivity**
- **Unified database configuration**: All services connect to shared PostgreSQL database
- **Connection string**: `postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/lab_manager`
- **Schema organization**: Each service has its own namespace within the shared database
- **Migration support**: Proper database initialization and migration handling

### 4. **Production-Ready Features**

#### Authentication & Security
- JWT token validation with Auth Service integration
- Configurable authentication requirements per service
- CORS support for frontend integration
- Security headers and request validation

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Automatic failure detection and recovery
- Configurable failure thresholds per service
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

#### Rate Limiting
- Per-service rate limiting configuration
- Redis-backed distributed rate limiting
- Adaptive rate limiting based on system load
- Proper HTTP 429 responses with retry-after headers

#### Monitoring & Observability
- Comprehensive health checks for all services
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Distributed tracing support
- Request/response logging with structured logging
- Performance monitoring and alerting

#### Load Balancing & Resilience
- Intelligent request routing
- Connection pooling and keep-alive optimization
- Timeout and retry configuration
- Graceful error handling

### 5. **Real-time Features**
- WebSocket support for chat functionality
- Connection management for real-time updates
- Event streaming capabilities

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created
1. **`unified_main.py`** - Production-ready gateway implementation
2. **`test_gateway.py`** - Comprehensive test suite
3. **`simple_test.py`** - Configuration validation

### Updated Files
1. **`config.py`** - Enhanced with proper service mappings and production settings
2. **`Dockerfile`** - Updated to use unified main
3. **`docker-compose.unified.yml`** - Enhanced environment configuration
4. **`pyproject.toml`** - Updated Python version requirements

### Service Configuration

Each service is configured with:
```python
ServiceEndpoint(
    name="Service Display Name",
    host="container-name",
    port=8080,
    path_prefix="/api/service",
    health_check_path="/health",
    rate_limit=300,
    require_auth=True,
    timeout=30,
    retries=3
)
```

### Environment Configuration

The gateway supports comprehensive environment-based configuration:
```yaml
# Core Settings
ENVIRONMENT: development
HOST: 0.0.0.0
PORT: 8000
VERSION: "2.0.0"

# Database & Cache
DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/lab_manager
REDIS_URL: redis://redis:6379/0

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET_KEY: "secure-key"
JWT_ALGORITHM: "HS256"

# CORS & Security
CORS__ENABLED: true
CORS__ALLOW_ORIGINS: '["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"]'

# Performance
REQUEST_TIMEOUT: 30
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS: 1000
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Configuration validation passed**
- All 21 services properly configured
- Service discovery working correctly
- Health check endpoints configured
- Authentication and authorization setup

✅ **Routing validation passed**
- Frontend API endpoints properly mapped
- Fallback routing to Lab Manager implemented
- Error handling for non-existent endpoints

✅ **Application startup validated**

```bash
cd /Users/paulgreenwood/Dev/tracseq2.0/lims-gateway/api_gateway
uv run python -m api_gateway.unified_main
```

### Docker Environment

```

### Full Stack
```bash
cd /Users/paulgreenwood/Dev/tracseq2.0/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.unified.yml up
```

## Gateway Endpoints

### Management Endpoints
- `GET /` - Gateway information and service status
- `GET /health` - Comprehensive health check with service dependencies
- `GET /services` - List all configured services with health status
- `GET /gateway/stats` - Gateway statistics and metrics
- `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation

### API Routing
- `/**/api/{service_path:path}` - Routes to appropriate microservice
- `/{path:path}` - Fallback routing to Lab Manager

### Real-time
- `WebSocket /ws/chat/{conversation_id}` - Real-time chat functionality

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Health Checks
All services have health check endpoints that the gateway monitors:
- Service availability
- Response time tracking
- Circuit breaker status
- Connection health

### Metrics
The gateway exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`:
- Request counts and latencies
- Service health status
- Circuit breaker states
- Rate limiting statistics

### Logging
Structured logging with:
- Request/response tracing
- Service call tracking
- Error reporting
- Performance monitoring

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Frontend Integration**: All frontend API calls properly routed to microservices
2. **Database Connectivity**: Unified database access across all services
3. **Production Ready**: Circuit breakers, rate limiting, monitoring, and security
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new services and modify routing
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full validation of configuration and connectivity
6. **Real-time Support**: WebSocket integration for live features
7. **Operational Excellence**: Health checks, metrics, and observability

The rewritten API Gateway now serves as a robust, production-ready entry point that seamlessly connects the TracSeq frontend to all microservices while maintaining database connectivity and providing enterprise-grade features for monitoring, security, and reliability.
