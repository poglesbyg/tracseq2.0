# TracSeq 2.0 API Gateway - Modular Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive modular refactoring of the TracSeq 2.0 API Gateway, transforming it from a monolithic 5000+ line file into a well-organized, maintainable, and scalable architecture.

## Problems with the Original Architecture

### 1. Monolithic Structure
- **Single massive file**: `simple_main.py` was 5034 lines long
- **Mixed concerns**: Authentication, routing, business logic, database operations all in one file
- **Hard to maintain**: Difficult to find, modify, or test specific functionality
- **Poor separation of concerns**: No clear boundaries between different layers

### 2. Code Duplication
- Multiple similar endpoints with duplicate logic
- Repeated error handling patterns
- Inconsistent response formats
- Duplicate configuration handling

### 3. Testing Challenges
- Difficult to unit test individual components
- Tight coupling between components
- Hard to mock dependencies
- No clear interfaces

### 4. Scalability Issues
- Hard to add new features without modifying the main file
- Difficult to extend functionality
- Poor code reusability
- No clear extension points

## New Modular Architecture

### 1. Core Infrastructure (`core/`)

#### Configuration Management (`core/config.py`)
```python
# Centralized configuration with environment variable support
config = get_config()
service_url = config.get_service_url("auth")
```

**Features:**
- Pydantic-based configuration with validation
- Environment variable support
- Hierarchical configuration structure
- Type-safe configuration access

#### Logging System (`core/logging.py`)
```python
# Structured logging with specialized loggers
from api_gateway.core.logging import service_logger, security_logger

service_logger.log_service_call("auth", "POST", "/login", 200, 0.5)
security_logger.log_auth_attempt("user123", True, "192.168.1.1")
```

**Features:**
- Structured JSON logging for production
- Specialized loggers for different concerns
- Request/response logging middleware
- Security event logging

#### Database Layer (`core/database.py`)
```python
# Enhanced database management with health monitoring
async with get_db_connection() as conn:
    result = await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM users")
```

**Features:**
- Connection pooling with health checks
- Automatic failover and recovery
- Performance monitoring
- Standardized database operations

#### Exception Handling (`core/exceptions.py`)
```python
# Custom exceptions with proper error responses
raise ServiceException("auth", "Service unavailable", 503)
```

**Features:**
- Custom exception hierarchy
- Standardized error responses
- Automatic error logging
- Security event integration

### 2. Middleware Layer (`middleware/`)

#### Authentication Middleware (`middleware/auth.py`)
```python
# JWT-based authentication with proper user context
@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_endpoint(user = Depends(get_current_user)):
    return {"user": user.email}
```

#### Security Middleware (`middleware/security.py`)
```python
# Comprehensive security headers and threat detection
app.add_middleware(SecurityMiddleware)
```

**Features:**
- Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
- Threat detection and blocking
- Suspicious activity monitoring
- CSRF protection

#### Rate Limiting (`middleware/rate_limiting.py`)
```python
# Adaptive rate limiting with circuit breaker integration
app.add_middleware(RateLimitMiddleware, requests_per_minute=100)
```

**Features:**
- Per-user and per-IP rate limiting
- Adaptive limits based on system load
- Circuit breaker integration
- Burst protection

### 3. Service Layer (`services/`)

#### Enhanced Proxy Service (`services/proxy.py`)
```python
# Circuit breaker protected service calls
response = await service_proxy.proxy_request("auth", request)
```

**Features:**
- Circuit breaker protection
- Automatic failover
- Health monitoring
- Load balancing support

#### Health Check Service (`services/health.py`)
```python
# Comprehensive health monitoring
health_status = await service_proxy.get_all_service_health()
```

### 4. Route Organization (`routes/`)

#### Modular Route Structure
```python
# Organized by domain
from .auth import auth_router
from .samples import samples_router
from .storage import storage_router

app.include_router(auth_router, prefix="/api/auth")
```

**Features:**
- Domain-specific route modules
- Consistent route patterns
- Proper dependency injection
- Clear separation of concerns

### 5. Application Factory (`app.py`)

#### Dependency Injection and Lifecycle Management
```python
# Clean application factory pattern
app = create_app()
```

**Features:**
- Proper dependency injection
- Lifecycle management
- Middleware configuration
- Route registration
