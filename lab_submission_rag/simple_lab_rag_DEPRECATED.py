DEPRECATED: Simple Laboratory Submission RAG System

This file has been refactored for better modularity. The original 999-line file 
has been split into smaller, more maintainable components.

NEW USAGE:
- Use simple_lab_rag_refactored.py for the main system
- Individual components are now in the simple/ directory:
  - simple.models: Data structures and Pydantic models
  - simple.document_processor: Document text extraction
  - simple.llm_interface: LLM interactions

MIGRATION GUIDE:
Old: from simple_lab_rag import SimpleLabRAG
New: from simple_lab_rag_refactored import LightweightLabRAG

This file is kept for reference but will be removed in future versions.
Please update your imports to use the refactored version.
