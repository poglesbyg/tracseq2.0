"""
Example Usage of the Laboratory Submission RAG System

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Process laboratory documents to extract submission information
2. Query the system about specific submission details
3. Export extracted data

Run this script after setting up API keys in a .env file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# OR 
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
