1. **Document Upload**: Upload your lab submission forms (PDF, Word, text files)
2. **AI Processing**: Our AI extracts sample information automatically with 85-95% accuracy
3. **Review & Validate**: Check extracted data and make corrections if needed
4. **Sample Creation**: Generate digital sample records with unique barcodes
5. **Storage Assignment**: Samples are assigned to appropriate temperature zones

**Supported Information:**
• Administrative: Submitter name, email, institution, project details
• Sample Details: Type, ID, volume, concentration, purity
• Source Material: Organism, tissue type, collection details
• Sequencing: Platform, coverage requirements, analysis type

**Tips for Best Results:**
• Use clear, structured documents
• Include complete contact information
• Specify sample types and requirements clearly
• Manual review recommended for critical samples"""
