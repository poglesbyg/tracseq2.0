## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The TracSeq 2.0 laboratory management system implements specialized business logic across several core domains:

### Laboratory Sample Processing
Core functionality resides in the laboratory submission and processing workflows:
- Multi-stage sample validation with confidence scoring
- Automated document extraction with laboratory-specific RAG processing
- Template-based sample creation with quality control gates
- Chain of custody tracking for regulatory compliance

File paths:
- `lab_submission_rag/rag_orchestrator.py`
- `lab_submission_rag/models/submission.py`

### Enhanced Storage Management 
Specialized storage system for laboratory environments:
- Temperature-controlled zone management (-80°C to 37°C)
- IoT sensor integration for environmental monitoring
- AI-driven storage optimization and predictive maintenance
- Digital twin modeling for capacity planning

File paths:
- `enhanced_storage_service/src/handlers/storage.rs`
- `enhanced_storage_service/src/ai/predictive_maintenance.rs`

### Laboratory Workflows
Domain-specific workflow implementation:
- Sample lifecycle state management 
- Quality control validation gates
- Sequencing job orchestration
- Laboratory document processing pipeline

File paths:
- `lab_manager/src/workflows/sample_workflow.rs`
- `lab_manager/src/services/qc_validation.rs`

### AI/ML Integration
Laboratory-specific AI implementations:
- RAG system for document processing and information extraction
- Computer vision for sample analysis
- Predictive analytics for equipment maintenance
- Anomaly detection for storage conditions

File paths:
- `lab_submission_rag/rag/document_processor.py`
- `enhanced_storage_service/src/ai/computer_vision.rs`

### Laboratory Notifications
Domain-specific notification orchestration:
- Multi-channel delivery based on alert severity
- Role-based notification routing
- Equipment and process-specific alerts
- Compliance-aware delivery tracking

File paths:
- `notification_service/src/services/notification_service.rs`
