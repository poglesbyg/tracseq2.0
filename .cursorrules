## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a laboratory management platform with integrated RAG-based document processing, consisting of three core components:

## Core Lab Management
- Modular architecture following IKEA-style assembly patterns for lab components
- Custom error handling and validation system specific to laboratory processes
- Sample tracking via barcode system with state transitions
- Template management for lab sample submissions
- Integration of RAG system for automated document extraction

## RAG Processing Engine
- Document extraction across 7 laboratory-specific categories:
  - Administrative Information
  - Source/Submitting Material
  - Pooling/Multiplexing 
  - Sequence Generation
  - Container/Diluent Specs
  - Informatics Requirements
  - Sample Details
- Domain-specific LLM prompting for lab document analysis
- Confidence scoring for extracted information
- Vector storage optimization for laboratory documents

## Workflow Orchestration
- Custom validation rules for sample metadata
- Sequencing job management with protocol validation
- Storage condition enforcement and tracking
- Template-to-sample mapping with validation
- Natural language querying of submission data

The system provides comprehensive laboratory workflow management with AI-assisted document processing and validation rules specific to laboratory operations.
