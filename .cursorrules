## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The LIMS microservice system implements laboratory information management with several key business domains:

## Core Sample Management
Located in `lims-core/sample_service/`:
- Sample lifecycle tracking through lab workflows
- Chain of custody validation and audit trails  
- Quality control checkpoints and validation rules
- Integration with lab equipment and storage systems

## AI-Enhanced Laboratory Operations
Located in `lims-ai/lab_submission_rag/`:
- Intelligent document processing for lab submissions
- RAG-based lab protocol assistance and knowledge base
- Multi-agent lab workflow orchestration
- Quality prediction and anomaly detection

## Enhanced Storage Management 
Located in `lims-enhanced/enhanced_storage_service/`:
- Temperature zone management and monitoring
- Digital twin simulation of storage facilities
- IoT sensor integration and alerting
- Predictive maintenance and capacity planning
- Energy optimization and carbon footprint tracking

## Laboratory Event Processing
Located in `lims-core/transaction_service/`:
- Saga pattern for multi-step lab workflows
- Compensation logic for failed lab procedures
- Laboratory event auditing and tracking
- Cross-service workflow orchestration

The system emphasizes laboratory compliance, sample integrity, and AI-assisted workflow optimization. Key integrations connect laboratory equipment, storage systems, and external LIMS/ERP platforms while maintaining strict validation rules for laboratory operations.

The business logic primarily revolves around:
- Sample tracking and chain of custody
- Laboratory workflow automation
- Storage condition monitoring
- Quality control procedures
- AI-enhanced decision support
- Regulatory compliance
