## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


LIMS Microservice System implements laboratory information management with AI-driven capabilities:

1. Core Laboratory Services:
- Sample tracking and management 
- Storage optimization with environmental monitoring
- Workflow orchestration for laboratory processes
