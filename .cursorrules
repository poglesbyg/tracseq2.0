## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The TracSeq 2.0 laboratory management system implements domain-specific business logic across several key components:

## RAG Laboratory Document Processing

### Document Analysis Engine
- Specialized extraction of laboratory information using AI models
- Document validation and confidence scoring for lab submissions
- Integration with local and cloud LLM providers
- Files: `lab_submission_rag/rag_orchestrator.py`, `lab_submission_rag/simple_lab_rag.py`

### Laboratory Submission Workflow
- Sample tracking and metadata management
- Chain of custody for sample movement
- Quality control validation rules
- Files: `enhanced_storage_service/src/services.rs`, `lab_submission_rag/models/submission.py`

## Storage Management System

### Intelligent Storage Allocation
- Temperature zone management (-80째C, -20째C, 4째C, RT, 37째C)
- Capacity optimization and predictive analytics
- IoT sensor integration for environmental monitoring
- Files: `enhanced_storage_service/src/handlers/storage.rs`

### Digital Twin Technology
- Virtual modeling of storage environments
- Simulation-based optimization
- Real-time synchronization with physical storage
- Files: `enhanced_storage_service/src/handlers/digital_twin.rs`

## MLOps Pipeline

### Model Management
- Laboratory-specific model registry
- A/B testing for extraction models
- Continuous learning from new submissions
- Files: `lab_submission_rag/mlops/model_registry.py`

### Experiment Tracking
- Custom metrics for laboratory data extraction
- Performance monitoring and validation
- Files: `lab_submission_rag/mlops/experiment_tracker.py`

## Enterprise Integration

### Notification Service
- Multi-channel laboratory alerts
- Priority-based message routing
- Template management for notifications
- Files: `notification_service/src/handlers/channels.rs`

### Event Service
- Laboratory-specific event handling
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Redis-based message broker integration
- Files: `event_service/src/events/handlers.rs`
