# TracSeq 2.0 Frontend Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive frontend improvements made to the TracSeq 2.0 Laboratory Management System to enhance **process delineation** and **temporal data visualization**. These improvements provide laboratory staff with clear visual representations of sample workflows and better understanding of time-based data throughout the system.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Process Flow Visualization (`ProcessFlow.tsx`)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Usage example
<ProcessFlow
  currentStatus="InStorage"
  timestamps={{
    created_at: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    validated_at: "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
    stored_at: "2024-01-15T16:45:00Z"
  }}
/>
```

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Usage example
<ProcessDashboard
  metrics={{
    totalSamples: 156,
    byStatus: {
      'Pending': 12,
      'Validated': 8,
      'InStorage': 23,
      'InSequencing': 15,
      'Completed': 98
    },
    averageProcessingTime: {
      validation: 4,
      storage: 2,
      sequencing: 48,
      overall: 72
    },
    recentThroughput: {
      last24h: 8,
      last7d: 42,
      last30d: 156
    },
    bottlenecks: [
      {
        stage: 'Validation',
        count: 12,
        avgWaitTime: 36
      }
    ]
  }}
/>
```

**Benefits**:
