# TracSeq 2.0 New Features Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented four new sections for TracSeq 2.0 laboratory management system:
- Library Prep
- Quality Control (QC)
- Project Management
- Flow Cell Design

## Database Schema Created

### 1. Project Management Schema (`db/migrations/project_service/001_initial_project_schema.sql`)
- **Projects table**: Track research projects with codes, status, priority, and team assignments
- **Batches table**: Manage sample batches with searchable batch numbers
- **Project files**: Hierarchical file/folder structure for project documents
- **Template repository**: Downloadable templates with version control
- **Permission queue**: Approval workflow for batch progression
- **Project sign-offs**: Multi-level approval tracking

### 2. Library Preparation & Flow Cell Schema (`db/migrations/sequencing_service/002_library_prep_flow_cell.sql`)
- **Library prep protocols**: Protocol definitions with kits and reagents
- **Library preparations**: Batch tracking with QC integration
- **Flow cell types**: Illumina flow cell specifications (NovaSeq, NextSeq, MiSeq)
- **Flow cell designs**: Lane assignments with AI optimization support
- **Flow cell lanes**: Detailed lane-level tracking

### 3. Extended QC Schema (`db/migrations/qaqc_service/002_extended_qc_schema.sql`)
- **QC metric definitions**: Configurable thresholds for library prep and sequencing
- **Library prep QC**: Comprehensive QC results tracking
- **Sequencing run QC**: Pre-run, mid-run, and post-run metrics
- **QC reviews**: Approval workflow with multi-level review
- **QC control samples**: Reference sample tracking
- **QC metric history**: Trend analysis capabilities

## Frontend Components Created

### 1. Library Prep Page (`lims-ui/src/pages/LibraryPrep.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - View and manage library preparation batches
  - Search by batch number
  - Protocol management with version tracking
  - QC status indicators
  - Detailed preparation information modal

### 2. Quality Control Page (`lims-ui/src/pages/QualityControl.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - QC dashboard with key metrics
  - Pending review queue
  - Recent metrics visualization
  - Review decision workflow
  - Control sample management tabs
  - Trend analysis placeholder

### 3. Project Management Page (`lims-ui/src/pages/ProjectManagement.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Project listing with priority and status
  - Batch tracking with search capability
  - Hierarchical file explorer
  - Template repository with download functionality
  - Team member and deadline tracking

### 4. Flow Cell Design Page (`lims-ui/src/pages/FlowCellDesign.tsx`)
- **Features**:
  - Interactive flow cell type selection
  - Drag-and-drop library assignment
  - Lane balance calculation
  - AI optimization integration
  - Visual lane representation with color coding
  - Real-time design statistics

## Navigation Updates
- Updated `Layout.tsx` to include new menu items
- Added routes in `App.tsx` for all new pages
- Updated version number to v2.0.0

## Key Features Implemented

- Database table for template metadata
- Version control support
- Download tracking
- Category-based organization

### 2. File/Directory Management
- Hierarchical folder structure
- Parent-child relationships
- File metadata tracking
- Visual file explorer component

### 3. Batch Number Search
- Searchable batch numbers across pages
- Integration with project management
- Real-time search filtering

### 4. Permission Queue
- Approval workflow for batch progression
- Multi-level sign-offs
- Status tracking and notifications

### 5. Flow Cell Design UI
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Visual lane representation
- AI optimization endpoint ready
- Balance score calculation

### 6. Project Sign-off Screen
- Multi-level approval tracking
- Role-based permissions
- Conditional approvals
- Expiry date support

## Technical Implementation
- Used TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Integrated with existing React Query patterns
- Followed existing UI/UX patterns with Tailwind CSS
- Created comprehensive database schemas with indexes
- Added proper foreign key constraints
- Implemented updated_at triggers

## Next Steps for Full Implementation
1. Create backend Rust services for the new endpoints
2. Implement AI optimization algorithms for flow cell design
3. Add real-time notifications for approval workflows
4. Integrate with existing laboratory instruments for QC data
5. Implement file upload/download functionality
6. Add comprehensive testing for new features
