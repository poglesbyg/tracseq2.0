## üéØ Next Steps to Complete Full Deployment

### Option 1: Use Existing Lab Manager Integration
Since you already have a working TracSeq system, you could integrate the Enhanced Storage Service as a microservice:

```bash
# Stop current minimal services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.minimal.yml down

# Go back to main TracSeq directory
cd ..

# Add Enhanced Storage Service to main docker-compose
# The infrastructure we created can be integrated into your existing system
```

### Option 2: Complete Standalone Deployment
To run the full Enhanced Storage Service independently:

1. **Fix Rust Build Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Install Rust toolchain
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source ~/.cargo/env
   
   # Generate Cargo.lock
   cd enhanced_storage_service
   cargo generate-lockfile
   ```

2. **Deploy Full System**:
   ```bash
   # Use the full deployment script
   .\deploy-local.ps1 deploy
   ```

### Option 3: Development Mode Integration
For development, you can run the Enhanced Storage Service alongside your existing TracSeq system:

```bash
# Use different ports to avoid conflicts
# Edit docker-compose.local.yml to change port mappings
# Run both systems simultaneously
```

## üåê Access Points (Current)

### Currently Active Services
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (postgres/postgres)
- **Redis**: localhost:6379 (caching ready)
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)

### When Full System Deployed
- **Main API**: http://localhost:8082 (109 endpoints)
- **Storage API**: http://localhost:8082/storage/*

- **Integrations**: http://localhost:8082/integrations/*
- **IoT Sensors**: http://localhost:8082/iot/*
- **Analytics**: http://localhost:8082/analytics/*

## üß™ Test Current Infrastructure

```bash
# Test database
docker exec enhanced_storage_service-postgres-1 psql -U postgres -d enhanced_storage -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM storage_locations;"

# Test Redis
docker exec enhanced_storage_service-redis-1 redis-cli ping

# Access Grafana
# Open http://localhost:3000 in browser (admin/admin)
```
