## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Rust
- PostgreSQL
- SQLx for database operations
- Actix-web for API endpoints

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Router for navigation

### Infrastructure
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- Nginx for production serving
- PostgreSQL for data persistence

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git
- Ports 80, 3000, 3001, 5173, and 5432 available
- **For RAG Integration**: Python RAG system running on port 8000 (see [RAG Integration Guide](docs/RAG_INTEGRATION.md))
- **For RAG Features**: OpenAI or Anthropic API keys (configured in RAG system)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lab_manager
   ```

2. Run the project:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Set up the environment
   - Build and start all services
   - Show access points and logs

## Access Points

- Production Frontend: http://localhost
- Production API: http://localhost/api
- Development Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Development API: http://localhost:3000

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
docker-compose up frontend-dev dev db
```

This will start:
- Frontend with hot reloading
- Backend with auto-rebuild
- PostgreSQL database

### Database Migrations

Migrations are managed using SQLx. To create a new migration:

```bash
cargo sqlx migrate add <migration_name>
```

To run migrations:

```bash
cargo sqlx migrate run
```

## Docker Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and restart services
docker-compose up --build -d

# View running containers
docker-compose ps
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are used:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `STORAGE_PATH`: Path for file storage
- `RUST_LOG`: Logging level for Rust application
