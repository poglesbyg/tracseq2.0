# TracSeq 2.0: Docker Compose to OpenShift Migration Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for migrating TracSeq 2.0 from Docker Compose to OpenShift, ensuring zero downtime and data integrity throughout the process.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Audit current Docker Compose deployment
- [ ] Map Docker Compose services to OpenShift resources
- [ ] Prepare OpenShift manifests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Create migration scripts

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (Week 3)
- [ ] Deploy OpenShift infrastructure
- [ ] Configure persistent storage
- [ ] Set up networking and security
- [ ] Deploy monitoring stack
- [ ] Test backup/restore procedures

### Phase 3: Service Migration (Week 4-5)
- [ ] Migrate stateless services first
- [ ] Set up database replication
- [ ] Migrate stateful services
- [ ] Configure service mesh
- [ ] Implement gradual traffic shifting

### Phase 4: Validation (Week 6)
- [ ] Run parallel environments
- [ ] Execute comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security validation
- [ ] User acceptance testing

### Phase 5: Cutover (Week 7)
- [ ] Final data sync
- [ ] DNS switch
- [ ] Monitor system health
- [ ] Rollback preparation
- [ ] Decommission old environment

## Service Mapping

| Docker Compose Service | OpenShift Resource | Notes |
|------------------------|-------------------|-------|
| postgres | Deployment + PVC | Use OpenShift PostgreSQL image |
| redis | Deployment + PVC | Use OpenShift Redis image |
| auth_service | Deployment + Service | Build with S2I |
| api_gateway | Deployment + Route | Expose via Route |
| volumes | PersistentVolumeClaim | Map to appropriate storage class |
| networks | NetworkPolicy | Implement zero-trust networking |
| secrets | Secret | Use OpenShift secrets management |

## Key Differences to Address

### 1. Networking
**Docker Compose:**
```yaml
networks:
  tracseq-network:
    driver: bridge
```

**OpenShift:**
- Use Services for internal communication
- Routes for external access
- NetworkPolicies for security

### 2. Storage
**Docker Compose:**
```yaml
volumes:
  postgres-data:
  redis-data:
```

**OpenShift:**
- PersistentVolumeClaims with appropriate storage classes
- Consider RWX storage for shared volumes
- Backup strategy using VolumeSnapshots

### 3. Environment Variables
**Docker Compose:**
```yaml
env_file:
  - .env
```

**OpenShift:**
- ConfigMaps for non-sensitive configuration
- Secrets for sensitive data
- External Secrets Operator for advanced secret management

### 4. Service Discovery
**Docker Compose:**
- Container names as hostnames

**OpenShift:**
- Service DNS (service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local)
- Service mesh for advanced routing

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# 1. Create database backup
docker exec tracseq-postgres pg_dump -U postgres tracseq > backup.sql

# 2. Create OpenShift database
oc apply -f openshift/base/postgres/

# 3. Restore database
oc exec -i postgres-0 -- psql -U postgres tracseq < backup.sql

# 4. Set up replication (if needed)
```

### Step 2: Application Migration
```bash
# 1. Build images in OpenShift
oc start-build auth-service

# 2. Deploy services
oc apply -f openshift/base/services/

# 3. Verify health
oc get pods -w
```

### Step 3: Data Migration
```bash
# 1. Stop writes to old system
docker-compose stop api-gateway

# 2. Final data sync
./scripts/sync-data.sh

# 3. Switch traffic
oc patch route api-gateway --type merge -p '{"spec":{"to":{"weight":100}}}'
```

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 hour)
```bash
# 1. Switch DNS back
# 2. Start Docker Compose services
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Verify system health
```

### Data Rollback (> 1 hour)
```bash
# 1. Stop OpenShift services
oc scale deployment --all --replicas=0

# 2. Restore database from backup
docker exec -i tracseq-postgres psql -U postgres tracseq < rollback.sql

# 3. Start Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## Validation Checklist

### Pre-migration
- [ ] All services building successfully
- [ ] Persistent volumes provisioned
- [ ] Secrets configured
- [ ] Network policies tested
- [ ] Monitoring configured

### During Migration
- [ ] Database replication lag < 1s
- [ ] No 5xx errors
- [ ] Response times normal
- [ ] All health checks passing

### Post-migration
- [ ] All endpoints responding
- [ ] Data integrity verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security scans passed
- [ ] Backups working

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data loss | High | Multiple backups, replication |
| Downtime | Medium | Blue-green deployment |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Load testing, gradual rollout |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Security scanning, network policies |
| Rollback failure | High | Tested rollback procedures |

## Communication Plan

1. **Stakeholder Notification**
   - 2 weeks before: Initial notification
   - 1 week before: Detailed timeline
   - 1 day before: Final reminder
