- Features:
  - Intelligent storage allocation
  - Temperature zone optimization
  - Predictive capacity planning

### ML Platform Services
- ✅ **Feature Store** - Running (basic health check passing)
- ❌ **Model Serving** - Not currently deployed
- ❌ **MLOps Pipeline** - Not currently deployed
- ❌ **AutoML Service** - Not currently deployed
- ❌ **ML Worker** - Not currently deployed

## Test Results

All integration tests passed successfully:

1. **Core Infrastructure Tests** (4/4 passed)
   - Ollama API Version check
   - Ollama text generation
   - RAG Service health
   - Cognitive Assistant health

2. **AI Query Tests** (2/2 passed)
   - Cognitive Assistant laboratory queries
   - Feature Store health check

3. **Integration Tests** (2/2 passed)
   - Storage Service AI features verification
   - Document processing readiness

## Example AI Capabilities

### 1. Laboratory Knowledge Queries
The system can answer laboratory-specific questions:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8015/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is the optimal temperature for storing RNA samples?"}'
```

### 2. Direct LLM Queries
Ollama provides detailed scientific responses:
- Example: "RNA samples should be stored at -80°C for long-term preservation"
- Response includes scientific justification and best practices

### 3. Document Processing
The RAG service can:
- Process laboratory submission documents
- Extract metadata using AI
- Provide intelligent search over processed documents

## Resource Usage

Current AI service resource consumption:
- **Ollama**: ~92MB RAM, 0% CPU (idle)
- **RAG Service**: ~42MB RAM, 0.29% CPU
- **Cognitive Assistant**: ~9MB RAM, 0% CPU (idle)
- **Feature Store**: ~76MB RAM, 0.54% CPU

## Next Steps for Full AI Integration

1. **Deploy ML Platform Services**:
   - Model Serving for advanced predictions
   - MLOps Pipeline for model management
   - AutoML for automated model training
   - ML Worker for background processing

2. **Enhance Cognitive Assistant**:
   - Remove placeholder responses
   - Implement proper prompt engineering
   - Add context-aware responses

3. **Expand Document Processing**:
   - Add support for more document formats
   - Implement batch processing
   - Add validation rules for extracted data

## Quick Test Command

To verify AI integration at any time, run:
```bash
/Users/paulgreenwood/Dev/tracseq2.0/scripts/test-ai-integration.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If services show as unhealthy but are functioning:
1. Check docker logs: `docker logs <container-name>`
2. Verify endpoints directly with curl
3. Restart specific services if needed: `docker restart <container-name>`
