# Issues Fixed Summary

## Date: 2025-01-20

### 1. Frontend Test Failures (AuthContext)

**Issue**: Two tests in `frontend/src/auth/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx` were failing:
- `persists authentication in localStorage` 
- `clears localStorage on logout`

**Root Cause**: The tests were trying to use localStorage methods that weren't properly mocked.

**Fix**: Added a proper localStorage mock implementation to the test file that provides all necessary methods (getItem, setItem, removeItem, clear).

**Status**: ✅ All AuthContext tests now pass.

### 2. React act() Warnings

**Issue**: Multiple test files were showing warnings about React state updates not being wrapped in act().

**Root Cause**: Asynchronous state updates from API calls and React Query were not properly awaited in tests.

**Fix**: 
- Wrapped all state-updating operations in `act()` 
- Added proper `waitFor` calls to wait for async operations to complete
- Fixed test setup to properly handle initial loading states

**Status**: ✅ Tests pass. Some warnings remain in TemplateEditModal and Samples tests but don't affect test outcomes.

### 3. ts-jest Configuration Deprecation

**Issue**: Jest configuration was using deprecated format for ts-jest settings.

**Root Cause**: ts-jest config was defined under `globals` which is deprecated.

**Fix**: Removed the `globals` section from `frontend/jest.config.cjs` as the ts-jest configuration was already properly defined in the `transform` section.

**Status**: ✅ Deprecation warning resolved.

### 4. Cargo Profile Warnings

**Issue**: Three Cargo.toml files had profile definitions that should be at the workspace level:
- `lab_manager/Cargo.toml`
- `transaction_service/Cargo.toml`
- `event_service/Cargo.toml`

**Root Cause**: Profile configurations were defined in individual package Cargo.toml files instead of the workspace root.

**Fix**: 
1. Moved all profile configurations to the workspace `Cargo.toml`
2. Removed profile sections from individual package Cargo.toml files

**Status**: ✅ Profile warnings resolved.

### 5. Rust Dead Code Warnings

**Issue**: Several Rust services had dead code warnings during compilation.

**Status**: ⚠️ Not fixed - These are non-critical warnings about unused code that can be addressed during regular development. They don't affect functionality.

## Summary

All critical issues have been resolved:
- Frontend tests are now passing
- Configuration warnings have been fixed
- The build process is cleaner with proper workspace-level profile configuration

The remaining console warnings in some frontend tests are non-blocking and can be addressed in future updates.
