## 🎨 **RUST 2024 EDITION FEATURES SHOWCASE**

### **Enhanced `let` Chains (Stabilized in 2024)**
```rust
// Now possible in Rust 2024:
if let Some(user) = get_user() && user.is_active() && let Some(role) = user.role() {
    // More readable conditional logic
    process_active_user_with_role(user, role);
}
```

### **Improved Error Handling**
```rust
// Better error propagation patterns
fn process_sample() -> Result<Sample, ProcessingError> {
    let data = fetch_data()?;
    let validated = validate_data(data)?;
    let processed = process_validated_data(validated)?;
    Ok(processed)
}
```

### **Advanced Pattern Matching**
```rust
// More expressive destructuring
match sample_result {
    Ok(Sample { id, status: SampleStatus::Completed, metadata, .. }) => {
        log_completion(id, metadata);
    }
    Err(ProcessingError::ValidationFailed { field, reason }) => {
        handle_validation_error(field, reason);
    }
    _ => handle_other_cases(),
}
```
