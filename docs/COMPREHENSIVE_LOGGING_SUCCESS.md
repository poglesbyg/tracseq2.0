## Implementation Architecture

### Centralized Logging Configuration
```python
# logging_config.py - Centralized configuration for all services
- JSONFormatter: Custom JSON formatter for structured output
- RequestLoggingMiddleware: HTTP request/response logging
- Performance decorators: @log_performance for operation timing
- Business event logging: log_business_event() for analytics
- Health check logging: log_health_check() for monitoring
```

### Service Integration
```python
# Each service integrates logging with:
logger = setup_logging("service-name", log_level)
app.add_middleware(RequestLoggingMiddleware, service_name="service-name")

# Performance monitoring
@log_performance("operation_name")
async def operation():
    # Business logic
    log_business_event("event_type", details)
