# MCP and Rust Microservices Research

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Overview

### What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard protocol introduced by Anthropic in late 2024, designed to standardize communication between AI applications and external data sources/tools. It's often described as a "USB-C port for AI applications."

### Key MCP Characteristics:
- **Standardized Integration**: Solves the MÃ—N integration problem by providing a common interface
- **Three Core Primitives**:
  - **Tools**: Executable functions (model-controlled) like API calls or database queries
  - **Resources**: Data sources/content (application-controlled) like files or API responses  
  - **Prompts**: Reusable instruction templates (user-controlled)
- **Architecture**: Client-server model with MCP Hosts, Clients, and Servers
- **Language Support**: SDKs available in Python, TypeScript, Java, C#, Rust, and more

### MCP for Rust
- **rust-mcp-schema**: Type-safe Rust implementation of the MCP schema
- **Multiple Schema Versions**: Supports 2024_11_05, 2025_03_26, and draft versions
- **Auto-generated**: Schemas automatically generated from official MCP specifications
- **Serde Integration**: Full serialization/deserialization support
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Active development with community contributions

## Playwright-Like Tools for Rust Microservices

### 1. **axum-test** (Primary Recommendation)
**What it is**: A dedicated testing library specifically designed for Axum-based web services (similar to how Playwright tests web applications).

**Key Features**:
- **TestServer**: Creates test instances of your Axum applications
- **TestRequest**: Builds HTTP requests against your services
- **TestResponse**: Handles and asserts responses
- **Built-in Serialization**: Automatic JSON/form data handling with Serde
- **Cookie & Header Support**: Full HTTP feature support
- **WebSocket Testing**: Built-in WebSocket testing capabilities
- **Multipart Forms**: Support for complex form data

**Example Usage**:
```rust
use axum::Router;
use axum_test::TestServer;
use serde_json::json;

let app = Router::new().route("/users", put(route_put_user));
let server = TestServer::new(app)?;

let response = server.put("/users")
    .json(&json!({"username": "test"}))
    .await;
```

**Why it's like Playwright for Rust microservices**:
- Direct application testing without external dependencies
- Comprehensive request/response handling
- Built-in assertions and validation
- Supports complex scenarios and workflows

### 2. **thirtyfour** (Web UI Testing)
**What it is**: Selenium/WebDriver library for Rust, closer to traditional Playwright functionality for browser automation.

**Features**:
- All W3C WebDriver methods supported
- Cross-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit)
- Action chains and JavaScript execution
- Screenshot capabilities
- Shadow DOM and alert support

### 3. **Integration Testing Approaches**

**Docker Compose + HTTP Client Testing**:
- Use `reqwest` for HTTP client testing
- `testcontainers-rs` for container-based integration testing
- `wiremock` for API mocking

**Microservice-Specific Testing Patterns**:
- Service mesh testing with actual network calls
- Contract testing with tools like Pact
- End-to-end testing across multiple services

## Rust Microservices Ecosystem

### Popular Frameworks:
1. **Axum**: Modern, ergonomic framework built on Tokio/Tower
2. **Actix-web**: High-performance, mature framework
3. **Warp**: Functional, composable web framework
4. **Rocket**: Type-safe, easy-to-use framework

### Testing Tools Landscape:
- **axum-test**: Service-level testing for Axum
- **actix-web-test**: Testing utilities for Actix-web
- **reqwest**: HTTP client for integration testing  
- **mockito**: HTTP mocking for testing
- **testcontainers-rs**: Container-based testing

## Recommendations

### For MCP Integration with Rust Microservices:
1. **Use rust-mcp-schema** for type-safe MCP protocol implementation
2. **Build MCP Servers** to expose microservice capabilities to AI systems
3. **Leverage Rust's async ecosystem** (Tokio) for efficient MCP communication
4. **Consider axum + MCP** combination for AI-integrated microservices

### For Playwright-Like Testing:
1. **Primary Choice: axum-test** - Most similar to Playwright for microservice testing
2. **Complement with**: Integration testing using `reqwest` + `testcontainers`
3. **For UI testing**: Use `thirtyfour` if you need browser automation
4. **Service mesh testing**: Combine multiple approaches for comprehensive coverage

## Industry Adoption

### MCP Adoption:
- **Early Adopters**: Anthropic (Claude), Block Inc., Codeium, Replit, Sourcegraph
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Open-source marketplaces and community tools emerging
- **Enterprise Interest**: Focus on standardizing AI-tool interactions

### Rust Microservices:
- **Performance Benefits**: Memory safety + speed advantages over traditional languages
- **Cloud Native**: Excellent Docker/Kubernetes support
- **Modern Architecture**: Built for async, distributed systems

## Conclusion

**For MCP**: Rust has solid MCP support through `rust-mcp-schema` and the growing ecosystem. It's particularly well-suited for building high-performance MCP servers.

**For Testing**: `axum-test` is the closest equivalent to Playwright for Rust microservices, providing comprehensive testing capabilities specifically designed for Rust web services. While not as mature as Playwright, it offers the same direct-application testing approach without external dependencies.

The combination of Rust's performance characteristics, robust async ecosystem, and growing MCP support makes it an excellent choice for building AI-integrated microservices.
