- ‚úÖ Step-by-step instructions
- ‚úÖ Required field information
- ‚úÖ Best practice recommendations
- ‚úÖ Links to relevant forms

### **Step 4: Document Processing (Optional)**
If you have a lab submission form:
1. Ask: "How do I upload a document for processing?"
2. Follow the AI's instructions
3. Upload your document (PDF, Word, or text)
4. Review extracted information
5. Confirm and create samples

## üéØ **Example AI Interactions**

### **Getting Started**
```
You: "Hello, I'm new to the system. Can you help?"

AI: "Hello! I'm your lab management assistant. I can help you with:
‚Ä¢ Submitting new samples  
‚Ä¢ Storage management
‚Ä¢ Sequencing workflows
‚Ä¢ Generating reports
‚Ä¢ System navigation

What would you like to start with?"
```

### **Sample Submission**
```
You: "I need to submit a DNA sample for sequencing"

AI: "I'll help you submit a DNA sample! You have several options:

1. üìÑ AI DOCUMENT PROCESSING (Recommended)
   ‚Ä¢ Upload your lab submission form
   ‚Ä¢ I'll extract all the information automatically

2. ‚úèÔ∏è MANUAL ENTRY
   ‚Ä¢ Fill out the sample form manually
   ‚Ä¢ I'll guide you through each field

3. üìä BATCH UPLOAD
   ‚Ä¢ Use Excel templates for multiple samples

Which method would you prefer?"
```

### **Storage Questions**
```
You: "What temperature should I store my RNA samples?"

AI: "For RNA samples, temperature is critical:

üå°Ô∏è STORAGE REQUIREMENTS:
‚Ä¢ RNA samples: -80¬∞C (temperature critical!)
‚Ä¢ Avoid freeze-thaw cycles
‚Ä¢ Use RNase-free storage tubes
‚Ä¢ Aliquot samples to minimize handling

üìç IN THE SYSTEM:
‚Ä¢ Create storage location at -80¬∞C
‚Ä¢ Assign specific freezer positions
‚Ä¢ Generate barcode labels
‚Ä¢ Track all sample movements

Would you like help setting up storage locations?"
```

## üîß **Advanced AI Features**

### **1. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
- Processes laboratory documents
- Extracts structured data
- Maintains context across conversations
- Learns from your laboratory's specific procedures

### **2. Local LLM (Privacy-First)**
- **Ollama running locally** - your data never leaves your system
- **No cloud dependencies** for basic AI features
- **Fast responses** - no internet latency
- **Secure processing** - HIPAA/PHI compliant

### **3. Multi-Modal Understanding**
- Text documents (any format)
- Spreadsheet data

- Review accuracy metrics

## üéØ **Best Practices for AI Usage**

### **1. Be Specific in Questions**
‚ùå "Help me"
‚úÖ "How do I submit a DNA sample for whole genome sequencing?"

### **2. Use Laboratory Terminology**
‚úÖ "What's the storage temperature for genomic DNA?"
‚úÖ "How do I set up an Illumina sequencing job?"
‚úÖ "What QC metrics should I track?"

### **3. Ask Follow-up Questions**
- "Can you explain that step in more detail?"
- "What if I don't have that information?"
- "Are there any safety considerations?"

### **4. Validate AI Responses**
- Cross-check critical information
- Verify with laboratory protocols
- Ask for clarification when needed

## üö® **Troubleshooting AI Features**

### **AI Not Responding**
1. Check service health: http://localhost:8000/health
2. Restart RAG service: `docker-compose restart rag-service`
3. Check Ollama status: `docker ps | grep ollama`

### **Slow Responses**
1. Local LLM processing takes time (normal)
2. Complex queries require more computation
3. Consider shorter, more specific questions

### **Inaccurate Extractions**
1. Review document quality (clear text, good formatting)
2. Use standard laboratory form templates
3. Provide feedback for system improvement
