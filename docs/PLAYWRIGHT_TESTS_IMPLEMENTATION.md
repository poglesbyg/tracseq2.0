# Playwright Tests Implementation for TracSeq 2.0 Python Services

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive Playwright testing framework for all Python services in TracSeq 2.0. This provides end-to-end testing capabilities for the AI/ML components of the laboratory management system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Test Infrastructure (`lims-ai/playwright-tests/`)

#### Configuration Files
- **`playwright.config.ts`** - Main Playwright configuration with multiple projects for each service
- **`package.json`** - Dependencies and test scripts
- **`tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript configuration for test files

#### Test Structure
```
lims-ai/playwright-tests/
├── tests/
│   ├── mcp-dashboard/          # MCP Dashboard UI tests
│   │   └── dashboard.spec.ts   # Dashboard functionality tests
│   ├── api/                    # API endpoint tests
│   │   └── enhanced-rag-service.spec.ts
│   ├── lab-submission/         # Lab submission UI tests
│   │   └── submission-ui.spec.ts
│   ├── websocket/             # WebSocket tests
│   │   └── mcp-proxy-ws.spec.ts
│   ├── ml-platform/           # ML platform tests
│   │   └── feature-store.spec.ts
│   └── utils/                 # Test utilities
│       └── test-helpers.ts
```

### 2. Test Categories

#### Smoke Tests (`@smoke` tag)
- Quick health checks
- Service availability
- Basic functionality verification

#### Integration Tests (`@integration` tag)
- Cross-service communication
- End-to-end workflows
- Transaction support

#### API Tests
- REST endpoint validation
- Response schema verification
- Error handling
- Performance metrics

#### WebSocket Tests
- Real-time communication
- Message routing
- Service orchestration
- Connection resilience

### 3. Services Covered

1. **MCP Dashboard** (Port 7890)
   - System health monitoring
   - Service status display
   - Performance metrics
   - Alert management

2. **Enhanced RAG Service** (Port 8100)
   - Document upload/processing
   - Information extraction
   - Similarity search
   - Q&A functionality

3. **Lab Submission RAG** (Port 8000)
   - Form submission UI
   - File upload processing
   - Confidence scoring
   - Export functionality

4. **MCP Proxy** (Port 9500)
   - WebSocket connections
   - Service discovery
   - Workflow orchestration
   - Transaction management

5. **ML Platform Feature Store** (Port 8090)

   - Drift monitoring

### 4. Test Utilities

**`test-helpers.ts`** provides:
- Test data generators
- Authentication helpers
- File upload utilities
- Notification checkers
- Performance measurement
- Accessibility checks

### 5. CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`):
- Matrix testing for each service
- Smoke tests → Integration tests pipeline
- Test artifact collection
- HTML report publication
- PR comment integration

### 6. Running Tests

#### Local Development

```bash
# Using npm scripts
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:smoke         # Smoke tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
npm run test:mcp          # MCP Dashboard tests
npm run test:rag          # RAG service tests
npm run test:ui           # UI mode
npm run test:debug        # Debug mode

# Using shell script
./run-tests.sh            # Run all tests
./run-tests.sh -t smoke   # Smoke tests
./run-tests.sh -s mcp-dashboard -h  # Specific service, headed mode
```

#### CI/CD
- Automated on push/PR to `main` and `dev` branches
- Daily scheduled runs
- Service-specific test matrices
- Artifact retention for debugging

## Key Features

### 1. Service Independence
Each service has its own test project configuration, allowing:
- Parallel test execution
- Service-specific baseURLs
- Independent failure tracking

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage
- UI interaction tests
- API endpoint validation
- WebSocket communication
- Performance monitoring
- Accessibility compliance

### 3. Developer Experience
- TypeScript for type safety
- Detailed test helpers
- Clear error messages
- Visual debugging with UI mode
- Video/screenshot capture on failure

### 4. Production Ready
- CI/CD integration
- Test result reporting
- Performance benchmarking
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile viewport testing

## Benefits

1. **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing of all Python AI/ML services
2. **Regression Prevention**: Catch issues before deployment
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
4. **Confidence**: Reliable deployments with comprehensive test coverage
5. **Developer Productivity**: Quick feedback on changes

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Coverage**:
   - Add more edge case tests
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Load testing scenarios

2. **Integration**:
   - Connect with existing Rust service tests
   - Unified test reporting dashboard
   - Test data management system

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Test execution metrics
   - Flaky test detection
   - Coverage reporting

## Usage Examples

### Testing a New Feature
```bash
# 1. Write your feature code
# 2. Add corresponding tests
# 3. Run tests locally
./run-tests.sh -s enhanced-rag-service -h

# 4. Run full suite before commit
npm test
```

### Debugging Failed Tests
```bash
# Run in debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/api/enhanced-rag-service.spec.ts --debug

# View last test report
npm run test:report
```

### CI/CD Integration
Tests automatically run on:
- Every push to main/dev branches
- Pull requests
- Daily at 2 AM UTC
- Manual workflow dispatch

## Conclusion

The Playwright test implementation provides comprehensive end-to-end testing for all Python services in TracSeq 2.0. This ensures the reliability and quality of the AI/ML components that power the laboratory management system's intelligent features.
