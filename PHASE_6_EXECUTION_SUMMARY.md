- 📄 `security/mtls/generate-certificates.sh`
  - Automated certificate generation for all services
  - CA certificate creation
  - Service-specific certificates
  - Certificate verification script

### 4. **Deployment Infrastructure**

#### **Monitoring Stack**
- 📄 `docker-compose.phase6-monitoring.yml`
  - Complete monitoring stack definition
  - Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, ELK Stack
  - Security monitoring with Falco
  - All necessary exporters

#### **Deployment Script**
- 📄 `deploy-phase6.sh`
  - Automated deployment process
  - Health checks
  - Performance configuration generation
  - User-friendly output

### 5. **Documentation**
- 📄 `docs/PHASE_6_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
  - Comprehensive implementation guide
  - Code examples for service integration
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Performance benchmarks

## 🎯 Next Steps for Deployment

### When Docker is Available:

1. **Deploy the Monitoring Stack**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-phase6.sh
   ```

2. **Update Microservices**
   Add observability instrumentation to each service:
   - Prometheus metrics endpoints
   - Jaeger tracing integration
   - Structured logging for ELK

3. **Configure Alerts**
   - Update AlertManager with actual notification endpoints
   - Set up Slack webhooks
   - Configure email settings

4. **Import Dashboards**
   - Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000
   - Import additional dashboards
   - Create service-specific views

---

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

After successful deployment:

### **Monitoring Capabilities**
- Real-time metrics for all microservices
- Distributed tracing across service calls
- Centralized logging with search capabilities
- Automated alerting for critical issues

### **Security Enhancements**
- mTLS between all services
- API rate limiting ready
- Security monitoring with Falco
- Certificate management automation

### **Performance Improvements**
- Database connection pooling configs
- Caching strategy implementation
- Circuit breaker patterns ready
- Performance baseline metrics
